# Algorithms
My realization of various algorithms on Java.

# Sorting
- bubble sort
- merge sort
- quick sort
- digit radix sort

# Basic algorithms
- fibonacci number and modulo
- gcd
- order statistic and median of collection of elements
- binary search
- prime factorization

# Data structures
- linked list
- matrix
- heap
- disjoint set union
- max value stack
- priority queue (based on heap and list)
- structure for the problem of finding the maximum in a sliding window (based on two max value stack)
- hashmap
- splay tree

# Concurrency
- rectangular right node integration method 
- tridiagonal matrix algorithm
- solving the differential equation by explicit and implicit methods using MPJ

# Data mining algorithms in spam filtering
- Naive Bayes classifier
- Nearest Neighbour classifier
- Neural Network classifier

# Machine learning
- genetic algorithm for TSP solving
- feedforward neural network
